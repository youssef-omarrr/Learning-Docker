### **Images**

- An **image** is like a blueprint or recipe.
    
- It contains everything needed to run an application: code, libraries, dependencies, environment settings.
    
- Images are **read-only** and are used to create containers.
    

> Example: Think of it like a cake recipe.

---

### **Containers**

- A **container** is a running instance of an image.
    
- It’s where the actual application runs.
    
- Containers are **isolated environments**, meaning each one runs separately.
    
- You can create, start, stop, or delete them anytime.
    

> Example: The actual cake made by following the recipe.

---

### **Volumes**

- A **volume** is a special storage location used to persist data.
    
- Data inside a container will be lost if the container is deleted, but data in volumes stays.
    
- Volumes are useful for databases, user uploads, logs, etc.
    

> Example: A separate storage shelf where cakes (data) are kept even if the kitchen (container) is cleaned.
